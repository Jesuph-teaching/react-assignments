### Assignment 1: Calculator App

**Description:**
Create a simple calculator application using React with class-based components. The calculator should have basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and should display the result of calculations.

**Requirements:**
- Use class-based components for the calculator and its buttons.
- Implement state management (`this.state`) to store input values and calculation results.
- Display the current input and the calculated result.
- Implement clear and backspace buttons to reset or remove the last input.

**Bonus:**
- Add support for additional operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
